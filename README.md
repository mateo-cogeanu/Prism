# [Prism Video Encoder](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Prism-Video-Encoder)

Prism Video Encoder is a simple web-based tool that converts video files into a custom `.pri` binary format. This tool enables users to read video files as raw binary data and save them with a `.pri` extension, making it easy to store and manage video content in a proprietary format. The tool is built using HTML, JavaScript, and the `FileReader` API for efficient file handling, all running in the browser with no need for server-side processing.

## Features
- **Convert video files to `.pri` format**: Simply upload any video file, and the encoder converts it to a custom binary format.
- **No server-side processing**: The tool works entirely in the browser, allowing for fast and secure encoding without needing a backend.
- **Easy to use**: Just upload your video, click the encode button, and download the `.pri` file.
- **Efficient file handling**: Uses the `FileReader` API to handle the video file efficiently and convert it to binary format.

## How to Use
1. **Upload a video file**: Click the "Choose File" button and select a video from your computer. Supported video formats include `.mp4`, `.webm`, `.avi`, and others.
2. **Encode to `.pri`**: After the video is uploaded, click the **Encode to Prism (.pri)** button.
3. **Download the encoded file**: Once the encoding is complete, a `.pri` file will be automatically downloaded to your computer. This file contains the raw binary data of your video.

## Example Workflow
1. Open the Prism Video Encoder in your browser.
2. Choose a video file (e.g., an `.mp4` file) from your computer.
3. Click the **Encode to Prism (.pri)** button to begin the encoding process.
4. Wait for the encoding to finish, and the `.pri` file will be downloaded.
5. Use the `.pri` file as part of your custom video workflow.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Provides the structure for the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the file reading and encoding logic.
- **FileReader API**: Used for reading files locally in the browser.
- **Blob API**: For creating downloadable file blobs from binary data.
